Here I have created a website for my hackathon using most basic tect stack:
  HTML
  CSS
  JS

This website is about cross category reccomendations, across [MOVIES, BOOKS, SONGS & PLACES]. 
This is a responsive website designed to be operated in both mobile & pc.
There will be further additions as it is updated.
